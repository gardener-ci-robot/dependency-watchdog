## Overview
A watchdog which actively looks out for disruption and recovery of critical services like `kube-apiserver` and `etcd`. 

If there is a disruption in the availability of `kube-apiserver` from the shoots then it will prevent cascading failure by conservatively scaling down dependent configured services and if a critical service like `etcd` has just recovered then it will expedite the recovery of dependent services/pods.

Avoiding cascading failure is handled by [`Prober`](/docs/concepts/prober.md) component and expediting recovery of dependent services/pods is handled by [`Weeder`](/docs/concepts/weeder.md) component. These are separately deployed as individual pods.
